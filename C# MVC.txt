-------------------------------------------------- [ MVC ] --------------------------------------------------
	
	- A web application framework developed by microsoft for building dynamic, data-driven web applications
	- It is a part of the larger ASP.NET framework and provides a pattern-based way to build scalable and maintainable web applications
	- The MVC architectural pattern separates an application into three main components [ Model | View | Controller ]
	
	- [ Cross-Platform ]   
		- ASP.NET Core is cross-platrform, meaning it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
		- This allows developers to chooose their preferred development environment
		
	- [Model-View-Conctroller (MVC Architecture Pattern)]	
		- [Model]
			- Represents the application's data and business logic
			- Responsible for retrieving and storing data, as well as defining the rules for data manipulation
			- Notifies the View whenever there is a change in the data
		- [ View ]
			- Rpresents the user interface UI of the application
			- Displays the data to the user and sends user inputs to the Controller for processing
			- The View is passive and does not contain business logic, it only displays infromation
			
		- [ Controller ] 
			- Handlers user input and update the Model accordingly
			- Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View processing user, requests, manipulating data, and updating the View
			- The Controller interprets the user's actions and decides which View to display
	- Structure Architecture
	
		- Dependencies
		- Properties
		- wwwroot
		- Controllers
		- Data			=> Data Access Logic
		- Models			=> UI Models
		- Services		=> Application Services (interfaces and implentations)	
		- Views			=> Presentation Logic	
		
		- app.config		
		- appsettings.json
		- bower.json
		- bundleconfig.json
		- program.cs
		- startup.cs
	
	- [ Middleware ]
		- ASP.NET Core uses a middleware pipeline to process HTTP requests and responses.
		- Middleware components can be added to customize the request-handling pipeline
	- [ Dependency Injection ]
		- ASP.NET Core includes a built-in dependency injection system, making it easy
		- To manageandinject dependencies into controllers and other components
	- [ Razor Views ]
		- Razor is the default view engine in ASP.NET Core MVC. 
		- IT allows developers to write both h HTML and C# code in the same file, making it easier to work with dynamic content
